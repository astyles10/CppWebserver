1. Make SocketIPv4::Run() handle reads & writes asynchronously by spawning processes for each
Bloat option: Use multi threading to handle reads/writes

WIP: Implemented process spawning for new connections & read/writes as async functions.
Incoming http requests were not terminating the blocking socket read. Added parameter to SocketIPv4::HandleRead
to return on special line terminator sequence.

2. Allow setting socket options - changing ports is getting annoying

WIP: Added SO_REUSEADDR & SO_REUSEPORT to SocketIPv4 constructor. Need to allow setting sock opt flags

3. Handle timeouts, different behaviours are occuring on different Linux flavours (man select)

4. Revise code design of socket library. Currently takes in callbacks for connection accepts, reads and writes.

Remove test code from SocketIPv4

5. Make sure incoming/outgoing data is converted to/from network byte order
